Hmm... Although I can't read this scribble, it must be <font color="LEVEL">Lekon's

Let me ask you a question. What do you think is the best methode to fight evil? There are many opinions, of course. But I think the best answer is to use that evil against itself.

When evil suddenly appeared in Gracia, we were curious about the source of that power. We studied it as best as we could. As a result, we learned to make weapons, shileds and many other useful battle tools using that evil spirit.

Unfortunately, it requires a huge sacrifice to obtain the necessary materials. You can only get them, in fact, by killing those evil creatures. I wish I could explain in greater detail, but I'm just a simple soldier. If you wish to speak with an expert in such matters, speak with *Special Products Broker Kutran at Kucereus' clan outpost*. He will be able to tell you more.
