You also need to know about the *Seed Collection*.

There are specific periods available for *collection* depending upon each Seed's cycle. Since what you collect can usually be used as ingredients in my work, I'll give you Adena when you gather and bring any of the following:

*Fragment of Soul* collected from the *Seed of Immortality*, and the *Breath of Tiat* collected from the *Seed of Destruction*.

They are useless to you, so an exchange will benefit us both.

Do you understand?
