!Kutran:

Would you like to know about the *Special Seed Products*? They are a type of crystal that contains each Seed's power and characteristics: the source of the evil power that has reduced Gracia to this pitiful state.

Despite the danger, however, there is no doubt that this same energy could greatly strengthen weapons and armor if we could infuse them with it. As Dilios has said, we must fight fire with fire, evil with evil.

It took me a long time, but I finally succeeded. The resulting weapons and armor are far more powerful than any I have seen before.

I call these crystals *Special Seed Products* and am ready to trade them to courageous adventurers. In fact, you can't afford not to have them.
