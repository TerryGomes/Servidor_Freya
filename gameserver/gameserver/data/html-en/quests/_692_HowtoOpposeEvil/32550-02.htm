!Kutran:

These Special Seed Products may give us the edge we need to defeat our enemies.

If you acquire the materials we need from the monsters of each Seed, I can process them. Then I'll exchange them for Special Seed Products.

You passed Dilis' test, so I suppose I can tell you exchange list:

*5 Nuclei of an Incomplete Soul* from the *Seed of Immortality* can be exchanged for *1 Nucleus of a Freed Soul*, *5 Mounted Troop Totems* from the *Seed of Destruction* can be exchanged for *1 Mounted Troop Charm*.
