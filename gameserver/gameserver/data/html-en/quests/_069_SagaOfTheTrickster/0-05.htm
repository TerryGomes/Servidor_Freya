!Hierarch Kekropus:

The woman in the blue dress distributed these Tablets of Vision all over the world.<br1>
It will be very difficult to find the locations of them all, hidden as they are in the secret and dangerous places.<br1>
Even if you do find their locations, you will still require a mystical object called the Resonance Amulet in order to decipher the secret of the Tablets...<br1>
The Demon Beleth is also seeking the knowledge contained within the Tablets -- you must prevent him from acquiring it at all costs!

[Quest _069_SagaOfTheTrickster accept|"I will find the Tablets before Beleth does."]
