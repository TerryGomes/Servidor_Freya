Ah! What could this stone be? I'm not the one able to tell about the nature of this finding, but we need to ask an expert to find it out.

The only person i can think of now is *Torai*, the one who wanders near the *South part of Death Pass*. Ah... he's looking for something that will never show to a greedy one.
