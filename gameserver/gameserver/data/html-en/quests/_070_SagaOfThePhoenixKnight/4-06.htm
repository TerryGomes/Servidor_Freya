!Eric Ramsheart:

There is an evil that lives deep within all knights' hearts... It's the spirit that ultimately corrupts knighthood.<br1>
Beleth is a seducer. His trap lies in the foundation of equality, an absolute virtue! He treats everybody equally. That is, he destroys and corrupts all.<br1>
But, that's not. We're not all equal. From the moment you resolve in your heart to become a protector, all others become either predators, protectors or protected.<br1>
The strength of your commitment is tested daily.<br1>
The path we walk flows deep with blood and gore. The longer you walk this path, the more that sticks to you, making your feet heavy and your sword dull.<br1>
And that's not the worst of it!
