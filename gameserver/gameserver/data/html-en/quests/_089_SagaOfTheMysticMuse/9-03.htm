!Tablet of Vision:

A sharp blast of knowlege courses through your cranium! A vision appears... of a black knight!<br1>
The location of the next Stone of Commune flashes into my mind! The next Stone of Commune...<br1>
*There is a suspicious figure near the next Tablet of Vision in the southeast of the Hunters Town. It seems the figure has the Stone of Commune.*
