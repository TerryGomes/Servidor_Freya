Whew, that was too close for comfort! Thank you! My name is Harkilgamed. Have we met before?<br1>
It is my duty to deliver this final Resonance Amulet to the pilgrims, and one of Einhasad's followers was trying to steal it before I could give it to you.<br1>
You have already heard, haven't you? There is someone searching for Enuma Elish. What, are you surprised?<br1>
