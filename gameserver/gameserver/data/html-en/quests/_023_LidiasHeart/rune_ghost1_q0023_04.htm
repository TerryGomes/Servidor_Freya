!Ghost of von Hellmann:

This concerns Lidia's Diary? Is that right? Oh, I see! Dear traveler! For whatever little time I have left, I'll read this diary and go over the past again and again in my mind!

Traveler, I shall reward you well for this diary! Dig underneath this tombstone and you will find my key!

Take that key to the Chamberlain of the Hellmann Family! You'll find him *in the village hidden in the middle of this forest*!
