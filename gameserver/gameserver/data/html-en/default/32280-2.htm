Oracle Guide:

A magnificent five-colored light spreads within an aquamarine sphere, and you hear a delightful voice:

Welcome to the Crystal Caverns! It is rather dark now, but if you could have seen this place before the Demon's invasion, you would not have been able to contain your amazement. According to the Oracle, we will soon regain that former glory....

Well, I must speak before my older sister becomes angry. I am the second child of the Oracle. My mission is to open a door for you. There are in fact 2 doors: one leads to the <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Square</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Steam Corridor</font>, while the other leads to the <font color="LEVEL">Coral Garden</font>. But -- alas! -- I can only open one of these doors!
