!Angelic Vortex:

In ancient times a mighty emperor named Baium became so enamored of his own power that he began to fancy himself a god.

He conscripted all of his people to build an awesome tower that reached almost to heaven.

The gods were not amused.

They struck him down, cursed him with immortality and imprisoned him in his own tower for eternity!

A statue of the foolish emperor stands there to this day.

Occasionally, the old emperor himself is woken up by those who seek his power. Unfortunately, when Baium is disturbed, so are the angels who guard him.

Although the angels are certainly no friend of Baium, they regard Humans with equal disdain.

*Ultimate success against Baium depends upon the defeat of the guardian angels.*

This is all I can tell you. Good luck!
