Oracle Guide:

The five-colored light slows its movement within the sphere, and the voice sounds dull and listless:

It is difficult for me to explain about my home being lost to the Demons. But it is my duty to answer your questions...

When you pass the first door, you will have to choose between the Emerald Square and Steam Corridor. The <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Square</font> used to be a beautiful place within the ocean depths, but now it is a mere playground for Crystalline Golems.

The <font color="LEVEL">Steam Corridor</font> is a narrow hallway above an underwater volcano that is infested with Demons!

The <font color="LEVEL">Coral Garden</font>, accessed through the second door, used to be a wonderful palace, but now insane water spirits wander its rooms.

In order to save Parme, you must liberate these three places from the demons. If you do not have a strategy already in mind, I suggest going through the first gate and choosing between the two paths.
