Oracle Guide:

A dim five-colored light shines forth from an aquamarine sphere, gradually growing brighter. You hear whispers in the air around you.

The three colors of crystals...you have collected them all? Marvellous...

I am the third child of the Oracle. Now I shall call upon the power of the crystal and bring you all before the chief of the Demons, <font color="LEVEL">Baylor</font>, guardian of this island. The Demon holds Shamaness Parme captive â€” you must defeat him in order to save her. Afraid...? Then I shall send you back to your world. This is against the Oracle's wishes, but you are not the only hope we have.

Take a moment and choose the path you wish to follow.
