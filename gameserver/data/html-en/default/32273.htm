Oracle Guide:

A red light shines forth from a aquamarine sphere and you hear a stirring voice.

Well done! I am the fourth child of the oracle, whose purpose it is to guide you through the Steam Corridor. You will have to repeat this process a couple of times. What do you say? Can you do it?

Let me know when you are ready and I shall send you to the next level.
