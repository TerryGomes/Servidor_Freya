Oracle Guide:

A mysterious five-colored whirlwind swirls within an aquamarine sphere, and you hear a clear, cultured voice.

Welcome. I am the first child of the Oracle. My mistress ia <font color="LEVEL">Parme</font>, the Shamaness of the Water Dragon. She is currently under the enemy's control, but an Oracle led me to this place just before she was captured.

My mission is to safely escort you to her current location.

Unfortunately, that place is unreachable without proper preparation.

If you are ready, please give me your hand, and I shall open the way.
