Oracle Guide:

Brilliant five-colored light shines forth from an aquamarine sphere. You hear a loud, clear voice:

Welcome, you who have accomplished the test of the Oracle. Your contributions have led to the downfall of the Demon Balor.

I am the last child of the Oracle, whose mission it is to escort you safely to the place where Parme is being kept. She is still under an evil influence, but the object you carry has the power to heal her.

If you are ready to meet the priests of the Water Dragon, give me your hand.
