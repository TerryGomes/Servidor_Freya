!Angelic Vortex:

The Angelic Vortex emits a faint light, in the midst of which an image appears.

A giant that normally appears as a stone statue has come alive and is fighting with many people.

Even angels have joined the fray.

It seems that the angels are angry at the humans who have broken the seal of the stone statue.

It appears impossible to cross over to that place right now. You have no choice but to wait until the fight is over.
