!Seer Manakia:

Some nightmarish images are tormenting me while i'm asleep, yes. Many days have passed and these mysterious dreams seem to have no end. If i could gather the elements needed to perform a ritual, with no doubt i would be able to understand what future is trying to tell me in that disturbing way.
