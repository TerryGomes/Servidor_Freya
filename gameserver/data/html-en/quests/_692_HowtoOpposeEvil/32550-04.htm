!Kutran:

These exchanges can benefit both of us. Let me recap:

*5 Nuclei of an Incomplete Soul* from the *Seed of Immortality* can be exchanged for *1 Nucleus of a Freed Soul*, *5 Mounted Troop Totems* from the *Seed of Destruction* can be exchanged for *1 Mounted Troop Charm*.

Regarding Seed collection,

*Fragment of Soul* collected from the *Seed of Immortality* and the *Breath of Tiat* collected from the *Seed of Destruction* can be exchanged for Adena.

Is that clear?
