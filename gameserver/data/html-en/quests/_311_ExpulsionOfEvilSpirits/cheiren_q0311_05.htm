What's holding you back? If you're not up for this mission, you'd better let me know now...

Otherwise, go hunt *Ragna Orcs* and the *Evil Spirit of Baranka, the Destroyer of Baranka*. Since they are possessed by evil spirits emanating from the *Ragna Orc Amulets* they wear, you must retrieve those accursed pendants. The more you bring me, the higher your reward.

Some Ragna Orcs carry the *Soul Core Containing Evil Spirit* instead of an amulet. If you collect 10 of those, you may challenge the Leader of the Ragna Orcs to a duel. Do not do so lightly!

[Quest _311_ExpulsionOfEvilSpirits reply_2|Say you want to quit.]

[Quest _311_ExpulsionOfEvilSpirits reply_3|Keep hunting.]
