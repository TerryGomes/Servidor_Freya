!Cheiren:

Let me tell you about the mission.

Hunt *Ragna Orcs* and the *Evil Spirit of Baranka, the Destroyer of Baranka*. Since they are possessed by evil spirits emanating from the *Ragna Orc Amulets* they wear, you must retrieve those accursed pendants. The more you bring me, the higher your reward.

Some Ragna Orcs carry the *Soul Core Containing Evil Spirit* instead of an amulet. If you collect 10 of those, you may challenge the Leader of the Ragna Orcs to a duel. Do not do so lightly!
