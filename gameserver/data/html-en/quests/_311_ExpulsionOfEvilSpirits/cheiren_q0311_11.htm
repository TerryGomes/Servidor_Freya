You have brought back 10 Soul Cores! If I combine the power of these cores with this pendant... like... so. This is the *Guardian Spirit's Pendant*! This item is absolutely necessary to stand against *Varangka*, the chief of the Ragna Orcs. Without this item, you will not be able to endure his evil powers.

Go west to Kasha's Altar and defeat him, and the power of the evil spirits in this place will be greatly decreased.
