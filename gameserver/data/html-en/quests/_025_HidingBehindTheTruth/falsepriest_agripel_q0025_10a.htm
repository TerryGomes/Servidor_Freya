!High Priest Agripel:

By the gods! You've slain the undead servant, who was created from the research on the magic of the necropolis and is both dead and alive!

Did you read the Contract? I feel bad about the Hellmann family, but someone had to shake things up and create a gap for us to enter through!

Nobody can stop us from infiltrating Elmore now!
