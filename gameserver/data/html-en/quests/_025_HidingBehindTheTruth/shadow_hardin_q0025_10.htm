!Mysterious Wizard:

I was preparing my magic. It's not easy to conjure an army without corpses, so I opened the door to the netherworld to steal the army of Shillen.

While I was preparing, Lidia took Rose's corpse. You know the story from there. I conjured Triol, and Triol made Lidia the Lord of the Forest of the Dead. In the meantime, I started some experiments.
