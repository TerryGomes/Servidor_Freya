!Grand Master Sedrick:

He said that the title of Duelist is nothing but a sham! He also said that becoming a Duelist is not a popularity contest.<br1>
He says that Swordmaster Iron, with his incredible reputation, shouldn't even be called a Duelist!<br1>
He called him a fake! Will you go and see him for me?
