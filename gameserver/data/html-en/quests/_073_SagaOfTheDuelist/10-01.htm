!Tablet of Vision:

There's a disturbance near the tablet.<br1>
Iron may be stronger than the warrior, but that doesn't guarantee the outcome of this battle.<br1>
He bears the scars of countless battles, as do I.<br1>
Is that the tablet, or is it an illusion? The sound of clashing swords snaps you out of your torpor.
