!Grand Magister Fairen:

First, meet* Messenger Naran Ashanuk* of the Varka Silenos tribe. They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to gain their trust!<br1>
*Soul Guide Udan Mardui*, the Chief Shaman of the Varka Silenos has a* Divine Stone of Wisdom* that we simply must have!<br1>
If things don't go well with the Varkas, try the Ketra Orcs. They also have a stone.
