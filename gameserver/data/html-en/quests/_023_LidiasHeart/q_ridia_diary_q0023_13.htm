!Lidia's Diary:

[A different handwriting]

I don't understand! Obviously I did it, but without knowing! I look in the mirror and her face looks back at me, but there is no mirror! Only an image. I don't understand any of this! Where are my memories? They seem to be there, but unaccessible! He must have done something to me!

Everything that happens is recorded but forgotten! Both regret and satisfaction are the result. The Moon Face Flower on your hairpin will seal this contract.
