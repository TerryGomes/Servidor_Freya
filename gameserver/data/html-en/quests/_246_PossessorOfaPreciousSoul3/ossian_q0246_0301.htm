!Ossian:

You must retrieve the staff Rain Song, the most powerful of the 3 items. With the power of this staff, the spell that is keeping the items from reaching their full strength can be broken.

However, since it is the most powerful item of the 3, it is also guarded by a most powerful foe:  Archangel Barakiel, the Flame of Splendor himself! To face him, you must prepare yourself for the fight of your life! Now go defeat Barakiel and retrieve the staff!
